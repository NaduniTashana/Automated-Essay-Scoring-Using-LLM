Q1_a,"Scenario: ABC (Pvt) Ltd. is a chain of supermarkets in Sri Lanka. Suppose you are asked to design a new version of the cash register machine for ABC. Question: Briefly explain what is ""Usability Engineering""?","1. Systematic approach to design. 2. Focuses on user needs and limitations. 3. Aims to ensure efficiency and user satisfaction.",10
Q1_b,"Scenario: ABC (Pvt) Ltd. is a chain of supermarkets... [Cash Register Project]. Question: Explain the importance of following the Usability Engineering Life Cycle approach for the assigned project in ABC (Pvt) Ltd.","1. Reduces development costs by identifying errors early. 2. Ensures the cash register interface matches the specific skills of cashiers. 3. Increases user satisfaction and efficiency at the checkout counter.",15
Q1_c,"Scenario: ABC (Pvt) Ltd... Question: State the Usability Engineering Life Cycle and explain each step/stage by providing examples referring to the above scenario.","1. Requirement Analysis (User/Task Profiling): Identifying cashiers as primary users and 'scanning items' as key tasks. 2. Design/Prototyping: Creating low-fidelity wireframes or mockups of the touch screen interface. 3. Evaluation/Testing: Conducting usability testing where cashiers perform mock transactions to measure speed and error rates. 4. Implementation: Deploying the final design to the supermarket counters.",55
Q2_a,"Context: Technology use can weaken cognitive abilities. Question: Explain the term ""cognitive ability""?","1. The mental capability to process information. 2. Includes memory, attention, perception, and reasoning. 3. Critical for interacting effectively with interfaces.",10
Q2_b,"Context: Technology use can weaken cognitive abilities. Question: Describe how you would redesign the below applications to increase human cognition, and what cognitive aspects can be improved? i. Calculator ii. Scheduling app iii. Spell-checker","1. Calculator: Show history tape to reduce working memory load. 2. Scheduling App: Use visual drag-and-drop to improve spatial reasoning. 3. Spell-checker: Provide context-aware suggestions to aid decision making. 4. General: Reduces cognitive load and improves attention.",45
Q3_a,"Context: Usability evaluation examines if a system is effective, engaging, and efficient. Question: Briefly explain the importance of usability heuristics in user interface (UI) designing.","1. Provides a standard checklist for interface design. 2. Helps identify major usability problems early. 3. Ensures consistency and prevents common design errors.",10
Q3_b,"Context: Usability evaluation examines if a system is effective, engaging, and efficient. Question: What is the main difference between usability testing and heuristic evaluation?","1. Usability Testing involves real users performing tasks. 2. Heuristic Evaluation involves expert evaluators inspecting the UI. 3. Testing is empirical (data-driven) while Heuristic is analytical (rule-based).",15
Q3_c,"Context: Usability evaluation... [Error Prevention]. Question: Error prevention is one of the usability heuristics. i. State the two (02) types of errors. ii. Explain how to handle the above errors by providing suitable examples.","1. Type 1: Slips (unconscious errors like typos). 2. Type 2: Mistakes (conscious errors due to wrong mental model). 3. Handling Slips: Use constraints (e.g., date pickers). 4. Handling Mistakes: Provide confirmation dialogs and undo options.",25
Q3_d,"Context: Usability evaluation methods. Question: Describe the following usability heuristics with suitable examples: i. Visibility of system status ii. User control and freedom iii. Recognition rather than recall iv. Flexibility of use v. Help users recover from errors.","1. Visibility: Keep user informed (e.g., loading bar). 2. Control: Allow 'Undo' and 'Redo' functions. 3. Recognition: Use visible menus instead of hidden commands. 4. Flexibility: Provide keyboard shortcuts for expert users. 5. Errors: Error messages should be in plain language, not codes.",50
Q4_a,"Context: Cognitive models allow designers to consider design decisions before getting user feedback. Question: Briefly explain Fitts' Law and Hick's Law (Hick-Hyman Law) by providing an example/scenario for each that you can apply in UI designing.","1. Fitts' Law: Time to target depends on distance and size. 2. Fitts Example: Make 'Buy Now' buttons large and easy to click. 3. Hick's Law: Time to decide increases with number of choices. 4. Hick Example: Simplify menus to reduce decision time.",24
Q4_b,"Context: GOMS is a family of predictive models of human performance. Question: Describe GOMS with suitable examples.","1. Goals: What the user wants to achieve (e.g., delete text). 2. Operators: Physical actions (e.g., press Delete key). 3. Methods: Sequences of operators (e.g., highlight -> delete). 4. Selection Rules: Deciding between multiple methods. 5. Example: Evaluating efficiency of mouse vs. keyboard shortcuts.",36
