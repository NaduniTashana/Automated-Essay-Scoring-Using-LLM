ABC (put) Ltd will provide beverages and (FMCG)
so they will mostly get teenage and sporting
users. And also they will get large ordering
users. So they must ready their System

2. Competitive analysis.
They must Consider the Competitive users machines
and identify their faillers and Features. And they
must improve them with their new needs. release,

3. Setting Goals.
Cash register machin Should be in low error

work individually and finally select the best design
for the continue the process process.
* participatory design
Designer have access to pool of representative users.
In here, There are are regular meeting between designer
and user users of cash register machine. solve the
problem in design process.
* coordinate design of total interface
consistancy is very important attribute in usability.
consistancy apply overall media use which form of total
user interface. It not just only application
screen, documentation, online help system and tutorial.
* prototyping
prototyping is interactive design process. des designer
create the prototype for new version of the cash
register machine before start the design.

* Empirical testing
This is type of usability testing method. sevirety
severeti severity rating is a part main method use in
this phases. In here, identify the issue of design
and ranking the severity for each problem.

* Iterative design
If cash register machine have any usability problem,

competative analysis- Have to to analysis the
competative cash register machines and get
an idea about the design of the system.

set usability goals - have to have a goal, to users
to make less errors- like one error
per month at most.

parallel design - design alternative designs for the
system and identify the best and most
suitable design

participatory design - design the system using users
who knows the domain or experts
of the domain.
coordinate design of to to total interface. - Have to
main tain consistency through out the whole
cash register machine -

Follow good guidelines and heuristics. - by following
we will be able to have simple and easy
easy to test usability, system.

prototyping - By doing that we can test system
using fake data- and we will be able
to identify issues with the cash register.

Empirical testing - We can test with real user.
user groups and identify issues
with the system.

Iterative design - By designing it iteratively
we can obtain a better system in each
iteration.

Follow up studies - we can also observe the
ex-released version and identify problems
and we can fix them in next release.",45

1. Visibility of the System status.
we System should show the status at the System
to the user.
for example if the screen getting data from
backend at the time we should show ->
loading screen to the user otherwise
user can't understand what's happen.
2. User Control and freedom.
System should not be make afraid to Use the
System. the System should allow the user
to use the system without fear.
- for example
if he deleted something he might able to
get that again from the recycle bin.
if he typed and remove the give the option
to undo.
3. Recognition rather than recall,
System make the user, when he show see the
System then he makes a decision can do his task
he don't need to remember all the steps
to remember the to do the task.
for example.
in the if the if in the commandline we
need to remember all the command to do a task
but from the UI we don't need to remember,
after we see the UI we can ready to
interact with it and do our task.

10. Flexibility and efficiency of UI,
When user using the application or system it should be
give flexibility to do the task and it works fine
with what exactly user want.
for example
when user order a food the follow and
placed order should be works without error or
any barrier, at the Same thing he should be
Show the order status doing driver location,
Cancel the order call with driver like that.

5. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from
errors.
when user do a task mistakey System should inform
to the user and give a way to recover from the mistake.
for example
if a user accidentally order a wrong food
then he should able to cancel the order,
or if when user try to placed order if there is
no delivery boy also available at the moment inform

This discribe user must show the present status in the screen. It mean user must not Confuse with empty screen On waiting with out any message.
As a example we can show When we loading some thing we need to show loading View and If their is empty Screen we must show empty message with even use image.
ex
[[Diagram: Two UI sketches. Left sketch shows a box containing a circular arrow icon and the text ""Loading"". Right sketch shows a box with ""Do List"" at the top and the text ""empty"" inside.]]

2) User control and freedom
It mean user must not uncomfortabele to use the system and move to One task to another Or terminate the task while processing. It mean user must not stuck in the System
Add back and navigation buttons Correctly
[[Diagram: Two UI elements. Left is a box containing ""KBack"". Right is a box containing ""X"".]]
I) Recognition rather than recall
Recognition is mean identify the any
item by does physically. Recall mean get
the item with have a 100% Correct path.
So recalling is very difficult to uses.
ex.
[[Diagram: A two-column table. The first column is empty with horizontal lines. The second column has a square drawn at the top, labeled ""Movies."" The rest of the second column is empty with horizontal lines. Below the table are the labels ""Command line"" under the first column and ""Files"" under the second column.]]

If we need to find a movie it is easy
to go movie and does check it but it
is difficult to use Command line to
correctly open it.

II) Flexibility and efficiently of use
Every user like to use user friendly
system. So flexibility and efficiency
mean the user can do the task with
very short time with short cuts and
.save the time. And also can do
the task very smoothly.

ex Keyboard short cut.
[[Diagram: A rectangular box with a vertical line dividing it. On the left side, there's a small square labeled ""ctrl"" at the bottom. On the right side, there are two small squares, one labeled ""c"" and the other ""v"", with arrows pointing from ""ctrl"" to ""c"" and ""v"". To the right of the box, text reads: ""Ctrl+C = Copy the item"" and ""Ctrl+v = paste the item"".]]
(v) Help users recognize, diagnose and
recover from errors.

'Every users doing errors. but
if they can't identify what they
did as a error It is problem.
So System must give them very clear
idea to the user what they
did as error. So System must
not give error Code as the
error message

ex:
[[Diagram: Two user interface dialog boxes, side-by-side.

by giving showing the status.

it should notify as ""Loading....."" to
the user. Then he knows what's happening.

an ""Exit"" button without knowing. while
he play playing the game.
at that time the device should
ask and conform it using comformation

II) User control and freedome – when user asked to
delete something user needs to be controled and
popup a question asking whether you really want
to delete them And give freedom to choose
either delete or go back with out delete.

Method :- Chain of actions
selection :- Decion Decision that make to choose a path.

eg:- Goal:- Click ok button. [[Diagram: A rectangular button outline with ""ok"" written inside it]]
operators :- 1. move hand from keyboard to mouse
2. point to mouse pointer to ok button.
